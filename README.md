## Note on `similarity.pkl` File  

Due to the large size of the `similarity.pkl` file, it exceeds GitHub's file size limit and cannot be hosted directly on this repository. However, you can download the file from the following Google Drive link:  

[Download similarity.pkl](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18yjPvQ5IslbJg_KqFIomJ27k05BMgKw2/view?usp=sharing)  

To run the project locally, please place the downloaded `similarity.pkl` file in the same directory where the `app.py` file is located.  

### Hosting Limitation  

Because of the file size issue, I am unable to host this site. You can still run the project locally by setting up the required files and dependencies as described above.
